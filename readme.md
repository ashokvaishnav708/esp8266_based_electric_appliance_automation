#B.Tech Final Year project.

This is an Electric Appliance Automation System based IoT Technology.

Elelctric Appliance Automation System, is the ideal solution for the electricity waste and many other 
remote power control applications. A person if forget to OFF his any Home Electric 
Appliance so, he/she can control or monitor his home electric appliances from any remote location using a web environment. 
Home Automation System will be driven by a microcontroller(ESP8266). It will use the wifi-Radio technology for IoT to interface with user. 

This project can be used to minimize wastage of electricity and monitoring switches in 
various sectors along with that providing it to common masses for implementation in houses 
at cheapest cost.

A person if forget to OFF his any Home Electric Appliance so, he/she can control or 
monitor his home electric appliances from any remote location using a web environment. 
Home Automation System will be driven by a micro-controller. It will use the wifi 
technology for IoT to interface with user.
At home, a person needs to manually ON/OFF the electric switches. Due to human error,
if it’s not done on time then there is wastage of electricity. To overcome this issues, an 
attempt is made through this project to remotely control the electric appliances of Home. 

Beside this it can also be used to remotely control the heavy energy consuming electric 
machines at Industries, Companies, Shops etc. As we see in our daily life that in most of the 
urban homes electric appliances remains ON because of its fast life which causes wastage of 
electricity, for overcoming this problem there must be a Home Automation system through 
which electric appliances can be controlled from any remote location.
It is a complete IoT based solution for Home Automation System. It can be utilized 
everywhere in Industries, Small scale Companies or startups, etc.

This project can be used by the government of India to minimize wastage of electricity and 
monitoring switches in various sectors along with that providing it to common masses for 
implementation in houses at cheapest cost.
Since it is IoT based project so it requires Internet connection to exchange information. 
So in this project I had used wifi based internet connectivity. It requires a router through 
which it will connect and router should have internet connectivity. 
There is a web environment where the server is being setup so as to deliver device status to 
device to control the switches attached to device.

It involves the control and handle the things like light, fan, door, alarming for certain 
remainders, security purposes etc. All the things are connected to the internet and all of them 
can accessed at any place and any time. Most popular protocol communication for the 
products include X10, Ethernet, ZigBee and Z-Wave, or other protocols are all incompatible 
with other. The web server is simultaneously updated by sensing the status of the things 
which are connected to the network. The status of the appliances is controlled by the switch it 
either ON or OFF using the computer technology. It also provides the security, energy 
efficient, and ease of use, hence it is adopted more. It also helps by providing to control and 
monitoring on web browser.

The device ESP8266, which is the embedded device used to access the cloud. The 
potential IOT applications develop the environment that covers all together the applications, 
command, control and routing process and security of the node and system. All the IOT 
devices include various objects like personal computer, smart phones, tablets, which gives the 
communication between the things and people and also the things between them. To reduce 
the need for the home intervention, we are used to control the electricity automation through 
the use of control systems.
